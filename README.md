Deque Toolkit Group Assignment

This project implements a double-ended queue (deque) data structure!
This deque supports the ability to insert and remove at both the front and the end
of the double dynamic array, as well as resizing when more space is needed, and
checking the size of the deque.

As expected with the guidelines for the assignment, we implemented:
> Push and Pop Methods
  - push_back(int value)
    - adds an element to the back of the deque
  - push_front(int value)
    - adds an element to the front of the deque
  - pop_back()
    - removes an element from the back of the deque
  - pop_front()
    - removes an element from the front of the deque

> Access Methods
  - front()
    - accesses the element at the front 
  - back()
    - accesses the element at the back

> Other Methods
  - size()
    - returns the size of the deque
  - empty()
    - checks if the deque is empty
  - resize()
    - resizes storage as needed
    
After cloning the repo, you can test by running the following command: ./run

NOTE: Unfortunately, we weren't able to implement the operator[] for random access of elements.
